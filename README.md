This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
<!-- DOAMINS:
Markd.io
    Qeep.it 
    LinkBin.io
    SecondBrain.dev
    ClipIt.so
    MarkThis.dev
    SaveIt.cc
    SnapUrl.io
    KeepTabs.app


    Note: Since .com names are hard to get, looking for .io, .app, or .dev domains usually gives you better names that are actually available.


    => Here are 20+ new suggestions categorized by the specific "vibe" of your favorites:

    1. The "Quick Capture" Vibe
        Similar to: ClipIt, SnapUrl, MarkThis Focus: Fast, efficient, immediate.
        SnipLink.io (Sharp, precise)
        GrabIt.dev (Action-oriented)
        PinWeb.so (Classic "pinning" metaphor)
        TagUrl.app (Simple and organized)
        PickLink.io
        CutPaste.dev (A nod to developer habits)

    2. The "Storage Container" Vibe
    Similar to: LinkBin, SaveIt, Qeep Focus: A dedicated place to dump/store things.
        LinkBucket.io (Casual, easy to "toss" things into)
        WebDepot.dev (Feels industrial and reliable)
        UrlJar.app (Simple, contained)
        StashBase.io (Developer-friendly term "Stash")
        https://www.google.com/search?q=StackUrl.com (Refers to the "Tech Stack")
        CodeCloset.dev (If you want to lean heavily into the dev angle)

    3. The "Smart/Memory" Vibe
    Similar to: SecondBrain, KeepTabs Focus: Enhancing your mind and organization.
        BrainBase.app (Alliterative, strong)
        MindExtend.io (Literal "Second Brain" meaning)
        Recall.dev (Simple, powerful)
        Memry.so (Short for Memory, trendy spelling)
        TabVault.io (Direct alternative to KeepTabs)
        WebMind.cc

    4. Short & Phonetic (SaaS Style)
    Similar to: Qeep.it Focus: Unique spelling, brandable.
        Stord.io (Stored)
        Lynk.dev (Link)
        Kapture.app (Capture)
        SyncIt.so
        Vult.io (Vault)
